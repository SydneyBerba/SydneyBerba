                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Due to her upbringing, Sydney became an <b>inquisitive and curious</b> person who always seeks to
                    understand
                    more about the world, especially in fields she is unfamiliar with. As a result, she took up BS
                    Accountancy, although she was a graduate of the Humanities and Social Sciences strand.
                    <br><br>
                    Furthermore, she is <b>detail-oriented</b> as she strives to make the best output in every project
                    she
                    participates in. Her go-getter personality enabled her to get opportunities to participate in
                    multiple organizations and competitions.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, she is a <b>logical</b> person who continues to balance her everyday life by creating
                    routines.
                    This is to ensure that every aspect–whether at home, school, or other settings, she is able to
                    allocate wisely her time and effort. Her constant management and planning of activities enable her
                    to truly be present in everything she participates in.

                <p> As her utmost priority in life, Sydney greatly prioritizes her responsibilities as the second eldest
                    of four children. Not only does she try to help in the daily household chores, but also in the
                    planning of activities such as travel itineraries in order to have a closer bond with them. Hence,
                    she has a strong relationship with her siblings and parents.

                <h3>Friends</h3>
                <p>Despite being closed-off during Junior High School, she was able to create and maintain meaningful
                    relationships with some of her classmates. These friendships extended to the present date.
                    Additionally, she was able to rekindle her friendship with people she was not close with during
                    highschool. Yet, this has not proven to be a hindrance to the current growing relationship she has
                    with them.
                </p>
                <p>College, on the other hand, has proven to be a challenge for her as it was more difficult to make
                    friends in the online setting. Yet, she was able to make friends with her peers who continue to help
                    and guide her to become a better person, not only socially but also in the academe.</p>

                    <br><br>
                    During her experience in Thomasian Youth Builders as the Executive Coordinator to the Treasurer,

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>During her pastime, Sydney engages in several hobbies that pique her interest and expand her
                    knowledge:</p>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Writing</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Writing is her favorite pastime as this release of thoughts, ideas, plans, and energy into paper is
                    truly an irreplaceable form of art. Sometimes, writing has been a competitive and publicized
                    activity for her. Yet, most of the time, this is an activity that is solemn and reflective. As a
                    result, there are around 20+ filled journals, notebooks, and notepads of ideas that were treasured
                    in secret.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>2. Reading</b>
                    <br><br>
                    From a young age, reading has been considered by her to be an indispensable hobby in order to learn
                    new vocabulary and perspective. This hobby extended up until adulthood wherein she participated in
                    online reading challenges from the website “GoodReads”. In these challenges, she strives to complete
                    a certain number of books in a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>3. Playing Video Games</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Her interest in video games is very notable as it just continuously increased over the years. Her
                    favorite games extended from outdated consoles such as the Nintendo Wii and PSP to PC (Personal
                    Computer)
                    games. Games such as Scribblenauts, Rocket League, and Super Mario Bros have not only been her
                    pastime, but also her outlet and application for logical thinking and creativity.
